# **Growth Mindset** 

*Growth mindset* to me means willingness to learn even though you may know little to nothing at all. Also being positive with words and thoughts avoided negative talk with made up scenerios. lastly decicating time to the subject to know more and find out what you dont know. My favorite line is > ***"Never give up"*** followed by >***Just don't give up***.

# **About Luis Valdovinos** 

My name is *Luis Valdovinos* I am *Mexican*, and I have been living in *portland Oregon* for the majority of my life. I am *29 years old* and I am looking to move into the *IT* field, coming from a *general labor* background all this seems like I am learning a new language. I am very excited and motivated to start a new career in *IT*. *IT* is also very intimidating but I look forward to completing this program and looking back at how much i have grown, what i have become, and what I still have to do for future me. I feel like i am too old to start school and a new career not being straight out of high school and 18 years old being that would have been somewhat normal. Nevertheless nothing is ever to late till the final whistle sounds. With that > ***"Never give up"***
